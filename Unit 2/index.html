            <h1 class="fade">The Black Death was a type of bacteria that in its worst case, cause fingers and other useless limbs to
                turn black, if this happened, it is nearly confirmed that you will die. It is most commonly known for
                killing 1/3 of Europe, it was eradicated due to the herd immunity law, social distancing, and other
                unknown factors. This was a huge struggle since it caused an early death to millions of people.</h1>

            <h1 class="fade" style="width: 90vw;">There were also conflicts, such as the 3 crusades. The crusades were mostly about
                ruling the “holy land” which was also known as Jerusalem. Jerusalem was holy to Muslims, Jews, and
                Christens for many reasons. For Christens, Jesus practiced miracles, was crucified, and rose from the
                dead here. There is also the Church of Holy Sepulchre. For Muslims, Mohammed rose from heaven in
                Jerusalem and the Dome of Rock is there. For Jews, the capital of the Jewish nation is here and was the
                location of the first temple, which was established by King Solomon. In the end, 4 things about medieval
                Europe change. The power of the pope increased, and subsequently did the church, breakdown of feudalism
                and growth of cities, beginning of loans and subsequently interest/credit, and new middle-eastern
                products were starting to sprinkle in the European market such as pepper, muslin, chess, algebra,
                coffee, rice, and more.</h1>

            <h1 class="fade" style="width: 90vw;">In medieval times, there was feudalism. Feudalism is a structure of power and roles that consisted of a
                King/Queen, Lords and Vassals, Knights (and their structure), Commoners, and Serfs (Slaves that owe a
                debt). Kings\Queens were at the top of the food chain and ruled the land. Lords and Vassals are right
                under the king and one of their most important jobs is to serve the king and he did so by paying his
                taxes and supplying him with his finest soldiers. Knights started as Pages where they became Squires at
                age 14, and they started to live with lords at age 7. Knighthood is only given if he is deserving of it,
                and is treated as the inner circle of the best warriors. Commoners were everyday people in the village
                and Serfs were slaves that had a debt. When their debt was paid, they would be free.</h1>

                executions!). Churches were very much to be feared in the Middle Ages. In addition to this, they also
                play a role in the Black Death, Feudalism, and the Crusades.

                known as Jerusalem. While it’s holy for different reasons to each group, for the Church, it’s where
                Jesus performed miracles and was crucified/brought back to life here. In the end, it impacted all who
                participated and changed how Muslims look at christens and “other hostile forces.”</h1>
