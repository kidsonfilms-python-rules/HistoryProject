            <h1>In the history of the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, and Medieval Christendom, there have been many
                factors that contributed to their growth and contractions but mostly, their technological innovations
                and their environment. Many events happened that led to the Roman Empire’s fall such as weak leaders,
                and the constant vandalizing that gave countries the courage to overtake them (Spielvogal 8-17). A Lot
                of things also happened to the Byzantine empire that allowed it to grow and medieval Christendom that
                allowed it to overtake the world by our times.

                such as the technological advancements and the environment are causing failures that will inevitably end
                in Rome’s death. First the technological situations. At Rome’s height, they had invented roads and
                improved aqueducts but also had high food prices which were a disadvantage to the lower class. Next, the
                environmental factors. The whole Mediterranean region is united under Rome.</h1>

            <h1>While the northern climate prevented them from farming and making items for trade, Rome was also a major
                trade site replacing the need for farming. They also had sea routes to trade. At its height, these
                environmental and technological innovations helped the Roman Empire grow. However, the lack of farming
                led to the contraction of the Roman Empire because they would lose those conquered lands eventually.
                Eventually, People just exchanged goods instead of money going backward of the progress they made with
                the economy, and vandals started to ravage Rome causing Romans to make the word “vandalism”.</h1>

            <h1>In the end, Theodores declares the west and east different empires, and Rome was renamed the Byzantine
                Empire marking the end of Rome. The biggest part of Rome wasn’t Rome itself, but it’s legacy. It left so
                many things, such as the base of the American legal system like the idea one is innocent until proven
                guilty. We also took Latin and made many other languages out of it such as Spanish, French, and English.
                We also took the republican form of government and their architecture/construction. In the finale, this
                was a contraction for the Roman empire since it has died due to both environmental reasons and
                technological innovations reasons stated above. (Spielvogal 8-17)</h1>

            <h1>The Byzantine Empire was the “new” Rome almost exactly replacing it but with a different way and new
                tactics to battle all of Rome’s mistakes. First the environment, the Byzantine Empire spread to Italy,
                South Egypt, and the east Arabian border. Constantinople’s position was central for nearly all trade and
                was easy to defend due to its location. Then. Belarius started to conquer Rome in hopes to bring it back
                to its former glory and managed to conquer Italy, Spain, and Northern Africa. Back in technological
                innovations, There was the Hippodrome.</h1>

            <h1>The Hippodrome was an oval arena that held more than 60,000 spectators for chariot races, imperial
                ceremonies, political demonstrations, and other events. And besides, Emperors enforced Roman laws, but
                eventually, the Empire became more Greek than Roman. For women’s rights, Theodora created more rights
                for women’s right to own land. The Hagia Sophia, the biggest structure of its time, was built and is
                still admired to this day. Many improvements to the schools and churches also happened to the Byzantine
                Empire. In the end, the financial and amenities increase has caused the Byzantine Empire to grow. They
                also conquered many lands. But, in the end, “Justinian's Plague” caused it all to go to waste.

            <h1>The medieval Christendom was a major part of human history. Christianity is the most popular religion
                with Islam and Hinduism following. You have to start the history of Christendom with Jesus of Nazareth.
                Jesus lived in Nazareth in Galilee or the region just north of Judea. Jesus traveled around Judea to
                help spread his message of Christianity. In the same period, Jewish Fortress, Masada, on a mountain top
                in Israel, and held off Romans for two years. Romans eventually overthrew it. Jesus also created many
                teachings and created a new way of living for many many people around him. Christens walked on roads
                speaking greek or Latin spreading Christianity. Empire Constantine converted to Christianity and made
                the Roman Empire into an all-new Christen Empire.</h1>

            <h1> Christen churches used a hierarchy of power systems when organizing their churches. They then made from
                the 4 gospels the New Testament which is sort of a Version 2.0.0 from the Old Testament which was from
                the Jewish. They finally then made a leader of all the churches, the Pope. Christianity did then split
                into two churches, The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Before the split,
                Christianity was booming, not just growing. It was spread all over the world and it was getting closer
                to more people than ever before. After this split, Christianity did grow but, not as one unit but as two
                divisions that rarely communicated between each other. But not even the split caused Christianity to
                contract, it was still growing.</h1>

            <h1>Most people were looking for peace so they turned to Christianity which was thought of as help for them.
                Germanic tribes then invaded Britain and then made it into Angland (aka England). Devout Christens in
                Eastern Roman Empire formed religious communities called monasteries. The women in these were called
                nuns. They made the Basilian Rule which stated a lot of rules for monks including that monks had to let
                in
                outsiders. Monks and nuns ran schools and hospitals for the sick. In the end, Christianity is still
                growing and all these facts and factors above are causing it, even today. (Spielvogal 26-47)
